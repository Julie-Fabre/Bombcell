Bombcell is a powerful toolbox designed to evaluate the quality of recorded units and extract essential electrophysiological properties. It is specifically tailored for units recorded with Neuropixel probes (3A, 1.0, and 2.0) using SpikeGLX or OpenEphys and spike-sorted with Kilosort.

### üìî Bombcell wiki

Documentation and guides to using and troubleshooting bombcell can be found on the dedicated [wiki](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/wiki).

### üèÅ Quick start guide

#### Overview

Bombcell extracts relevant quality metrics to categorize units into four categories: single somatic units, multi-units, noise units and non-somatic units.

Take a look at [`bc_qualityMetrics_pipeline`](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/blob/master/bc_qualityMetrics_pipeline.m) to see an example workflow.

#### Installation

To begin using Bombcell:
- [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the [repository](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/bombcell) and the [dependancies](#Dependancies).
- add bombcell's and the dependancies' folders to [MATLAB's path](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pathtool.html).
- in addition, if you want to compute ephys properties, change your working directory to `bombcell\ephysProperties\helpers` in matlab and run `mex -O CCGHeart.c` to able to compute fast ACGs, using a script written by Micha√´l Zugaro.

#### Dependancies

- https://github.com/kwikteam/npy-matlab (to load .npy data in).
- If you have z-lib compressed ephys data, compressed with [mtscomp](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/mtscomp), you will additionally need the [zmat toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71434-zmat). More information about compressing ephys data [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/05/24/2023.05.22.541700.full.pdf?%3Fcollection=). 
- to compute fast ACGs, we use a function written by Micha√´l Zugaro, and it is already included in bombcell.
