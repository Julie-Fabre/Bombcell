üì¢ **I will be giving a talk on quality metrics and bombcell at 4:40 BST on the 17th of October 2023, as part of the 2023 Neuropixels course. To attend the talk, register for the course [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDuDIW-u2oGFhkyLTPRqH1pU6esn5xJgm5Zh2YBg-xVEfvmg/viewform) (the talks are online and free).**

Manual curation of electrophysiology spike sorted units is slow, laborious, and hard to standardize and reproduce. Bombcell is a powerful toolbox that addresses this problem, evaluating the quality of recorded units and extracting essential electrophysiological properties. Bombcell can replace manual curation or can be used as a tool to aid manual curation.

Bombcell is specifically tailored for units recorded with Neuropixels probes (3A, 1.0, and 2.0) using SpikeGLX or OpenEphys and spike-sorted with Kilosort. If you want to use bombcell in conjunction with another spike sorting algorithm, please raise a [github issue](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/issues), create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), or email [us: juliemfabre[at]gmail[dot]com](mailto:juliemfabre@gmail.com). Follow us on [twitter: basal_gang](https://twitter.com/basal_gang) for updates on bombcell.


### üìî Bombcell wiki

Documentation and guides to using and troubleshooting bombcell can be found on the dedicated [wiki](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/wiki).

### üîçÔ∏è How bombcell works

Below is a flowchart of how bombcell evaluates and classifies each unit:

### üèÅ Quick start guide

#### Overview

Bombcell extracts relevant quality metrics to categorize units into four categories: single somatic units, multi-units, noise units and non-somatic units.

Take a look at [`bc_qualityMetrics_pipeline`](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/blob/master/bc_qualityMetrics_pipeline.m) to see an example workflow.

#### Installation

To begin using Bombcell:
- [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the [repository](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell/bombcell) and the [dependancies](#Dependancies).
- add bombcell's and the dependancies' folders to [MATLAB's path](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/pathtool.html).
- in addition, if you want to compute ephys properties, change your working directory to `bombcell\ephysProperties\helpers` in matlab and run `mex -O CCGHeart.c` to able to compute fast ACGs, using part of the [FMAToolbox](https://fmatoolbox.sourceforge.net/).

#### Dependancies

- [npy-matlab](https://github.com/kwikteam/npy-matlab) to load .npy data in.
- [prettify-matlab](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/prettify_matlab) to make plots pretty.
- If you have z-lib compressed ephys data, compressed with [mtscomp](https://github.com/int-brain-lab/mtscomp), you will additionally need the [zmat toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71434-zmat). More information about compressing ephys data [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2023/05/24/2023.05.22.541700.full.pdf?%3Fcollection=). 
- MATLAB toolboxes:
    - Signal Processing Toolbox
    - Image Processing Toolbox
    - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
    - Parallel Computing Toolbox

In addition we would like to acknowledge:
- to compute fast ACGs, we use a function (`CCGHeart.c`) part of the [FMAToolbox](https://fmatoolbox.sourceforge.net/), and it is already included in bombcell.
- the functions to compute distance metrics and signal-to-noise ratio are based on functions in [sortingQuality](https://github.com/cortex-lab/sortingQuality)
